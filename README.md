This project has 2 clear objectives:
* Learn how to work with JDBC
* Apply our knowledge about procedures, triggers, events and DLC

During the developing of this project, we had to connect to a remote server and learn how was the database structure there.
Then based on that, create a new database, with its procedures and events, to store the data imported from the server.
